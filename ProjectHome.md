This project develops plug-and-play electronic tour guide software for touring parks. The mobile component has the four standard functions (cartographer, navigator, librarian, and messenger) identified by Abowd, et al (1997). It also has non-standard features such a marketeer function for deploying promotions and a pollster function for collecting visitor feedback. The desktop component, which we call the mapineer browser, enables tour designers to develop and deploy plug-and-play content without the aid of programmers or system administrators. The main informational web-site is at geoplicity.org.
